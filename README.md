## Problem Statement

This Report helps the company understand its sales performance better. It provides insights into which products are driving the most revenue and profit, and which ones are underperforming. By analyzing sales trends across different time periods (daily, monthly, quarterly, annually), the company can identify peak seasons and areas where improvement is needed.

Through the relationship between sales and profit, management can identify if high sales are actually translating into profitability. The dashboard also highlights the top and bottom-performing products in terms of sales, profit, and quantity sold, giving the company a clear picture of where to focus its strategy.


Overall, this Report enables the company to identify growth opportunities, reduce losses, and improve overall business decisions.
